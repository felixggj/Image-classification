# Full-Stack Image Classification Deep Learning Project with a Flask Front-End
*Felix Gomez-Guillamon Jurado*

**Model Training can be seen on the file 'ImageClassification .ipynb'**

Deep Learning Image Classification model which detects whether a person is happy or sad by giving a percentage of certainty to its prediction. Used several machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV. Other libraries such as Matplotlib and Numpy were used to display the modelâ€™s performance. 

The Model is able to predict whether a person is sad or happy from any image that is uploaded outside the dataset used for training the model.

### Front-End implementation
Flask Front-End implementation can be found on the file 'app.py' and templates folder for the HTML files. 
Some of the functionalities of the Front-End are:
- Using WerkZeug to let the server send cookies to the client and encrypting the cookies using a unique secret key.
- Everytime a user uploads a picture and then clicks 'submit', the server will save the image in the 'static/uploaded_images' directory. This folder will contain the image/s uploaded by the user.
### Steps to run the project
#### Two Options:
##### Google Colab (Using Colab's GPU)
- Install all neccessary dependencies
	- Can be found on the 'requirements.yaml' file
- Upload the 'ImageClassification.ipynb' file to Google Colab
##### Local Computer - Silicon ARM Mac (recommended)
###### For Model Visualization
- Download <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>
- Create a new virtual environment with conda using 'requirements.yaml' file
	- Conda env create -f requirements.yaml
- Conda install jupyter (ignore if already installed)
- Create a specific jupyter kernel for the project for the virtual environment
	- python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ImageClassification
- Open Jupyter Lab / Notebook

###### For Front-End Implementation Demo
- Download <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>
- Create a new virtual environment with conda using 'requirements.yaml' file
	- Conda env create -f requirements.yaml
- Download .zip file of the project
- Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder
- Run 'python app.py'
- Open a browser and go to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/'
- Upload an image and click 'submit'
- The model will predict whether the person is happy or sad and display the percentage of certainty of its prediction
