# Image Classification
*Felix Gomez-Guillamon Jurado*

Deep Learning Image Classification model which detects whether a person is happy or sad by giving a percentage of certainty to its prediction. Used several machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV. Other libraries such as Matplotlib and Numpy were used to display the modelâ€™s performance. 

The Model is able to predict whether a person is sad or happy from any image that is uploaded outside the dataset used for training the model.


### Steps to run the project
#### Two Options:
##### Google Colab (Using Colab's GPU)
- Install all neccessary dependencies
	- MatplotLib
	- TensorFlow
	- Numpy
	- OpenCV
##### Local Computer - Silicon ARM Mac (recommended)
- Download <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>
- Create a new virtual environment with conda using ImageClassification.yaml
- Conda install jupyter (ignore if already installed)
- Create a specific jupyter kernel for the project
- Open Jupyter Lab / Notebook
